# FizzBuzz
A FizzBuzz solution for Best Buy's interview process.

# Usage

IN CLOUD:
You can access this application through this API endpoint https://8xfmipwcsk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/fizzbuzz. To make a request to this endpoint send an array of values in JSON format. Here is an example request body in Postman [1,3,5,15,"A",23].

# Of Note
One requirement of this project was to return an "Invalid Item" when there is invalid JSON. Due to time constrains I've just handled invalid JSON as an error.
